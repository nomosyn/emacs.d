/**
 * This class is stateful | stateless.
 *   StatelessClass: provides methods working without side effects:
 *   they can be replaced with their value without changing the behavior
 *   of a program.  (Result does not depend on the state of a db for
 *   example.)
 *
 *   StatefulClass: provides methods working on instances => side
 *   effects (like on a db for ex).
