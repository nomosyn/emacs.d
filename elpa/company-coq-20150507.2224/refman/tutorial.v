(*******************************************)
(** Welcome to this company-coq tutorial! **)
(** Here's a demo of a few nice features  **)
(*******************************************)

(** First of all, let's ensure that company-coq is running. Did you add

      (package-initialize)

      ;; Open .v files with Proof-General's coq-mode
      (require 'proof-site)

      ;; Load company-coq when opening Coq files
      (add-hook 'coq-mode-hook #'company-coq-initialize)

    to your .emacs? If not, you can try company-coq temporarily; just type
    `M-x company-coq-initialize'. *)

(** Let's get started! If you use emacs >= 24.4, the symbols below should be
    prettified, though they appear as ASCII in the source file. You can disable
    this feature by typing M-x prettify-symbols-mode. If the symbols show as
    square boxes instead, you may want to install a good unicode font, such as
    Symbola (package `ttf-ancient-fonts'; see the github page for more info). *)

Definition PrettySymbols : (nat -> nat -> Prop) :=
  (fun (n m: nat) =>
     forall p, p <> n -> p >= m -> True \/ False).

(* Try typing an arrow `->' here: *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** company-coq knows most basic Coq tactics. Typing just a few letters are
    enough to locate a tactic, and pressing RET inserts it. If a tactic contains
    holes, you can navigate them using TAB *)

(* Try typing `SLD RET' here: *)
(* Try typing `applin RET' here: *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** You can also insert math symbols directly in the source file, using LaTeX *)

(* Try typing `\gam RET' here: *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** company-coq adds a few convenient shortcuts, like M-RET and M-S-RET, to
    insert additional match cases *)

Ltac BasicTactic :=
  match goal with
  | [ H: ?a /\ ?b |- _ ] => destruct H
  (* Place the point on the empty line before `end', and press `M-S-RET'. *)
  (* You can press C-d to remove the contents of a field and move to the next *)

  end.

(******************************************************************************)

(** Not sure what a tactic does? Type part of its name, and press C-h. *)

(* Try typing `appl C-h' here: *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** Completion is smart enough to look for theorems and tactics in the current
    buffer (and with the proper Coq patches, in the whole library). For example,
    it knows about BasicTactic and PrettySymbols *)

(* Try typing `BasicTac' here: *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** company-coq can extract an outline of your proof script; it includes links
    to each definition, theorem, and lemma. *)

(* Try pressing `C-c C-,'. Press q to exit the outline buffer. *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** Now for a few interactive features. You'll want to start the prover *)

(* Start Coq by pressing C-c RET here *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** Now that Coq is started, company-coq can auto-complete library modules *)

(* Try typing `Require Import Coq.Z.B' here: *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** In addition to lemmas, tactics, and type definitions from the current
    buffer, company-coq also monitors Coq's responses for lists of identifiers,
    and adjusts completions accordingly *)

(* Run the following snippet, then try typing `plus': *)
SearchAbout eq. 

(******************************************************************************)

(** Confused by an error message? company-coq has documentation for (some) of
    them, auto-extracted from the manual *)

(* Consider the following attempt at using Omega: *)

Require Import Omega.
Lemma refl : forall x, exists (y: nat), x = y.
Proof.
  (* Run the following line and inspect the error message: *)
  Fail omega.

  (* Now press `C-c C-a C-e' (Error). This suggest adding intros: *)
  intros.

  (* Try running omega again: *)
  Fail omega.

  (* Pressing C-c C-a C-e again. Suggests that this wasn't the right approach
     after all. *)
  eauto.

  (* By the way, did you notice that the goals line looked different? (If you're
  using Emacs â‰¥ 24.4) *)
Qed.

(******************************************************************************)

(** Even if you know what the error means, sometimes it's hard to parse: *)

(* Evaluate the following block: *)

Inductive Tr {T} := TrL : T -> Tr | TrB : Tr -> Tr -> Tr.
Inductive Tt : @Tr Type -> Type := TtL : forall A, A -> Tt (TrL A) | TtBr : forall t1 t2, Tt t1 -> Tt t2 -> Tt (TrB t1 t2).

Fixpoint MkLarge {A} d (l ll:A) :=
  match d with O => TrL ll | S n => TrB (MkLarge n l l) (MkLarge n l ll) end.

Lemma inH: forall T n (t: T), inhabited (Tt (@MkLarge Type n T T)).
  intros; constructor; induction n; simpl; constructor; eauto. Qed.

Lemma LargeGoal : inhabited (Tt (@MkLarge Type 5 unit nat)).
  pose proof (inH unit 5 tt) as pr; simpl in *.
  Set Printing All.

  (* Run up to this point. The next command fails, due to a type error: *)
  Fail exact pr.

  (* This message is not very readable, as the two terms are very similar. It
     would be much nicer with just a diff of the two types. company-coq supports
     this: type `M-x company-coq-diff-unification-error'. Type q to exit. *)

  Unset Printing All.
Abort.

(******************************************************************************)

(** Another nice feature is goal extraction. Let's prove a theorem by
    induction: *)

Lemma my_plus_comm :
  forall p q r,
    (p < q /\ q < r) ->
    (p + q < q + r) ->
    (exists s, p + q + r < s) ->
    forall n m, n + m = m + n.
Proof.
  induction m.
  - auto.
  - idtac.
    (* Evaluate everything up to this point. Wouldn't the proof would look nicer
       if this was a separate lemma? *)
    (* Press `C-c C-a C-x` to automatically extract a lemma from your goal. You
       will be prompted for a name, then for hypotheses to keep in your lemma
       (hint: you only need IHm). Try it on the empty line below: *)
    
Abort.

(******************************************************************************)

(** To conclude, here's one final neat feature: source view. You can ask
    company-coq to print the definition, from the source, of any symbol for
    which sources are available. *)

(* Try typing PrettySymb and pressing C-w *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** Good luck with your proofs! Don't hesitate to submit ideas and patches to
    https://github.com/cpitclaudel/company-coq/, and if you use Coq, Proof-
    General, and company-coq for your research, don't forget that citations are
    highly appreciated! *)
