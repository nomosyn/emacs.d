  - [ ] A note should refer to its package.yaml using an url and a hash.

  - [ ] A package.yaml file should contain these info on the note:
      - uuid: unique uuid that identity the note
      - hash: unique hash that identify the content of the note
      - version: number that gives an order to the set of content associated to a given note
      - summary: a one line summary of the note
      - licence: enough information for the note to be considered a CC-BY-SA licenced content
      - dependencies: a list of elements, each one indicating a resource on wich
        this note is based on.
      - result:
          - url: to locate the note
          - hash: to make the located content unique
          - keywrods: tree made of its sections names to make this note
            searchable by concepts.
      - package_name: indicates what is the name of the package format used in package.yaml
      - package_version: indicates which version of this package format is used

  - [ ] The hashes in the package.yaml and the note should make it possible to
    uniquely locate an identify each other.

  - [ ] Filling these meta informations should be automatized as much as
    possible.
