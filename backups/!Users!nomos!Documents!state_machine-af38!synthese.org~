* Building programs like houses

  - "Thinking doesn’t guarantee that we won’t make mistakes. But not thinking
    guarantees that we will"
  - Thinking means writing a spec
  - rule of thumb: "The spec should say everything one needs to know in order to
    use the method. After the code has been written and debugged, no one should
    ever have to read it.
  - "The key to understanding complexity is abstraction, which means rising
    above the code level. The best language for being simple and precise is math
    — the kind taught in elementary math courses: sets, functions, and simple
    logic"
