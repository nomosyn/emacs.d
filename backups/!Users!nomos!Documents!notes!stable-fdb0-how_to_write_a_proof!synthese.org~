* How to right a proof

  - "The best way I know to eliminate errors is to imagine that there is a
    curious child sitting next to us. Every time we write an assertion, the
    child asks: Why?"

  - Example:

      - If f'(x) > 0 ∀ x ∈ interval I, then f is increasing on I.
          1. It suffices to:
               1. assume
                    1. a and b are points in I 2.
                    2. a < b
               2. prove f (b) > f (a).
                  Proof: By definition of an increasingfunction.

          2. There is some x in (a, b) with f'(x) = .
             Proof: By assumptions 1.1 and 1.2, the hypothesis that f is
             differentiable on I , and the Mean Value Theorem.

          3. f'(x) > 0 ∀ x ∈ (a,b)
             Proof: By the hypothesis of the corollary and assumption 1.1.

          4. (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a) > 0
             Proof: By 2 and 3.

          5. Q.E.D.
             Proof: Assumption 1.2 implies b −a > 0, so 4 implies f(b)−f(a) > 0,
             which implies f (b) > f (a). By 1, this proves the corollary.

  - Template:

      - <Assertion to prove>

          - <Sufficient condition that makes the assertion true>
            <Proof>

          - <Assertion>
            <Proof>

          - <Assertion>
            <Proof>

          - ...

          - Q.E.D
            <Proof>

  - How much detail is necessary? It depends on the "sophistication of the reader"


  - "If you are writing the proof for yourself to make sure that the theorem is
    correct, then the answer is simple: if the truth of a statement is not
    completely obvious, or if you suspect that there may be just the slightest
    possibility that it is not correct, then more detail is needed. When you
    write a proof, you believe the theorem to be true. The only way to avoid
    errors is to be ruthlessly suspicious of everything you believe. Otherwise,
    your natural desire to confirm what you already believe to be true will
    cause you to miss gaps in the proof; and every gap could hide an error that
    makes the entire result wrong."
