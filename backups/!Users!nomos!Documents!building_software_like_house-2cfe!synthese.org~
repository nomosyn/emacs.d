* The web of names, hashes and UUIDs

  - To keep track of documents that change in a distributed untrusted network,
    we need them to have a [[492e][distributed document header]].

  - <<492e>> distributed document header := Defines a header that contains at
    least:

      - Its name because convenient and easy to use

      - Its uuid because allows to track content that changes with time

      - Its hash (SHA<version>) because allows total precision in managing content
