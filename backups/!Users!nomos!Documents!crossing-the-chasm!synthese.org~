#+TITLE: Synthèse : Crossing the Chasm

* [[0-06662-002-3][Crossing the Chasm]]

  The [[ec46][Chasm]] is a battle field that most start-up need to cross.  The war is so
  intense that we model it using the [[f3d9][D-Day]] analogy.  Winning the war means
  defining a [[8163][positioning]] making the [[01cd][whole product]] the only viable solution for
  the customer in the target [[dd57][market]] segment. The unique beachhead target [[dd57][market]]
  segment is choosen applying the [[74c4][market development checklist]] to a collection
  of [[1636][scenarios]] built from [[0526][informed intuitions]]. Keep in mind that it is way more
  difficult to cross the [[ec46][Chasm]] in a consumer [[dd57][market]] than a business market.

**  Chasm

    <<ec46>> Chasm := in the [[f558][Technology Adoption Life Cycle]], transition from
    [[a014][early market]] to [[194b][majority market]] because their business conditions are
    contradictory.  When [[a014][early market]] is saturated, there are no customers for a
    while.  You become a target for competitions already in the [[194b][majority market]]
    and a target for new entrants in the [[a014][early market]].  Customers don't want you
    here as you disturb their conservative habits.  Expectations of investors
    are nevertheless present... some use this period to get control of startup
    tech.



*** Market

    <<dd57>> Market :=

          - [ ] set of actual and/or potential customers

          - [ ] for  given set of products

          - [ ] who have a common set of needs

          - [ ] and reference each other when making a buying decision



*** Discountinuous Innovation

    <<ce12>> Discountinuous Innovation := a product that needs the customer to
    change its habits to acheive a task.



*** Technology Adoption Life Cycle

    <<f558>> Technology Adoption Life Cycle := [[file:img/technology-adoption-life-cycle.png][Tech Adoption Life Cycle]]
    each section represents a [[47ad][phychographic profile]] := [[[c978][innovators]],
    [[7699][early adopters]], [[8e70][early majority]], [[ac74][late majority]], [[9084][laggars]]]



**** Phychographic profile

     <<47ad>> phychographic profile := "combination of psychology and
     demograhics that makes them ≠ from other groups"



****  Innovators

      <<c978>> innovators := a few people...

          - [ ] <<a961>> ... with these business conditions :=
              - [ ] latest and greatest tech

              - [ ] no need to make huge profits out of them

          - Willing to test tech in alpha stage + rank it against
            competitors.  Only source of trust when marking a tech as
            "good" or "bad" => advise "big bosses" about purchases
            ([[7699][early adopters]]).



**** Early adopters

     <<7699>> early adopters :=

        - ||early adopters|| > ||innovators||, may have millions
          dollars to invest.

        - [ ] <<b918>> Business conditions :=

            - [ ] buy a product vision...

            - [ ] with a [[ce12][discountinuous innovation]] as its heart.

            - [ ] Adopting this product should bring high personal
              recognition and rewards.

            - [ ] First, they like a project: "going where no man has
              gone" and going with them.

            - [ ] The key of this relation is for the entrepreneur to
              "productize" development of the tech as it goes: set a
              serie of milestones defined as :=

                - [ ] Accomplishable in mere mortal time

                - [ ] marketable product for the vendor

                - [ ] Provide the customer with a ROI that can be
                  celebrated as a major step forward.



**** Majority market

     <<194b>> majority [[dd57][market]] is where profits happens. It's composed of:

        - <<8e70>> early majority := ||early majority|| > ||early adopters||,
          pursuing a product for pragmatic purposes.

            - [ ] <<de70>> Business conditions:

                - [ ] strong references (other early majority clients)
                  assuring that tech works...

                - [ ] ... and will last.

                - [ ] product must mean incremental, measurable and
                  predictable progress.

        - <<ac74>> late majority := ||late majority|| ~ ||early majority||

                      - [ ] Business conditions:

                          - [ ] [[de70][early majority business conditions]]

                          - [ ] product has become a "standard" => profits



**** Laggars

     <<9084>> laggars := not interesting.



**** Early market

     <<a014>> Early [[dd57][market]] := {innovators, early adopters}.

         - [ ] Business condition :=

             - [ ] [[a961][Innovator business conditions]]

             - [ ] [[b918][Early adopter business conditions]]

         - [ ] False start if:

             - [ ] the company sells the vision before it has a
               product.  At best, the entrepreneurial compagny secures
               a few pilot projects, but as schedules continue to slip,
               the visionnary's position in the organization weakens
               and support for the project is eventually withdrawn.

                 - Remedy: do one thing: turn pilot into product for the
                   customer and marketable object.

             - [ ] Too much ambition, not enough money/skills/...



*** D-Day analogy

    <<f3d9>> D-Day analogy :=

        - The model :=

            - Products and companies ~ The allies

            - Early market ~ England

            - The english channel ~ The Chasm

            - Strategic market segment in the mainstream ~ Beaches of Normandie

            - Entrenched competitors ~ The axis

            - Majority market ~ Eisenhower's Europe

        - The key point is to focus an overabundance of support relatively to
          a [[dd57][market]] that can be referenced by a broader
          [[dd57][market]] in the [[194b][majority market]].

        - [ ] The more serious the problem you solve in this strategic nich
          the faster you'll get out of the chasm: price the value of solving
          this problem and rank it.

        - [ ] This nich will let you access other ones: sum the money you can
          make within each of them, this is how much you are supposed to make.

        - [ ] For a platform, achieving critical density/mass is key for crossing
          the Chasm: use a closed community and be the central agent of
          it... then extend.
            - Applications are the domain of end users when platform are the
              domain of IT.  IT is conservative, end users less and can force
              the IT department to move. clothe the platform as an
              application.



*** Whole product

    <<01cd>> Whole product := ∃ a ≠ between the value proposition made to the
    customer and the ability of the shipped product to fulfill it.  product +
    additional services that fulfill this ≠ makes the whole product.  [[file:img/whole-product.jpg][Whole
    product model]]. The right side of the [[ec46][Chasm]] buy whole product, the left one
    are ok with the basic product and happy with the augmented product.  How
    much should we add to our product so that it becomes a good enough whole
    product?  [[file:img/simplified-whole-product-model.jpg][simplified whole product model]].  To build it, start from the
    beachhead customer [[1636][scenario]] and be as practical as possible.



*** Informed intuition

    <<0526>> Informed intuition := isolate a consumer pattern like "visionaries"
    or "pragmatists" and go for them.  This pattern should be compelling enough
    that it just stick and people around you just grasp it when heard.



*** Scenario

    <<1636>> Scenario :=

          - [ ] One A4 page that make obvious the value of a product for a User:

              - [ ] Header:

                  - User:

                      - for consumer market: age, sex, economic status, social group

                      - for business markets: industry, geography, department, job title

                  - Technical buyer: Who is in charge in the User to evaluate if yes or
                    no a product spec match a need.

                  - <<6a45>> Economic buyer: Who is in charge in the User to evaluate if yes or
                    no the price of a product to solve a technical need is worth
                    it.

              - [ ] <<ba35>> A day in the life, before:

                  - [ ] Scene: Moment of frustration, what is the user about to attempt
                    ?

                  - [ ] Desired outcome: What is the user trying to accomplish? Why is
                    it important?

                  - [ ] Attempted approach: without the new product, how does the user
                    go about the task?

                  - [ ] Interfering factors: What, How and Why does it goes
                    wrong?

                  - [ ] Economic consequences: So what? What is the impact of
                    the user failing to accomplish the task productively?

              - [ ] A day in the life, after: same as [[ba35][before]] except:

                  - [ ] New approach: with the product, how does the end user go
                    about the task?

                  - [ ] Enabling factor: What is it about the new approach that
                    allows the user to get unstuck and be productive?

                  - [ ] Economic rewards: what are the costs avoided or benefits
                    gained?

              - Example: p96



*** Market development checklist

    <<74c4>> Market development checklist := To rank [[1636][scenarios]] against this
    list of criterions, each from 1 to 5.  The first 4 criterions filter for
    valid beachhead, others are "nice to have":

          - [ ] Target customer: is there a single, identifiable, creditworthy,
            accessible to sales channels, [[6a45][economic buyer]] for the [[01cd][whole product]]?
            If you want to be a 10m$ company, aim at a 10m$ [[dd57][market]] because you
            have to be the leader of it.

          - [ ] <<d697>> Compelling reason to buy: economic consequences wrt product
            solution worthy to be implemented?

          - [ ] [[01cd][whole product]]: can our company with the help of partners and
            allies field a complete solution to the target [[d697][compelling
            reason to buy]] in the next 3 months such that we can be in the
            market by the end of next quarter and be dominating the market
            within the 12 months thereafter?

          - [ ] Competition: "Never attack a fortified hill".  Has this problem
            already been addressed by another company such that they have
            crossed the [[ec46][Chasm]] ahead of us and occupied the space we would be
            targeting?

          - [ ] Partners and allies: existing relationship with other companies
            needed to fulfill the [[01cd][whole product]]?

          - [ ] Distribution: Do we have a sales channel in place that can call
            on the target customer and fulfill the [[01cd][whole product]] requirements
            put on distribution?

          - [ ] Pricing: Does price match the releive to fix the targetted pain?
            The distribution of this money accross all actors is sufficiently
            appealing?

          - [ ] Positionning: Is the company credible as a provider of products
            and services to the target niches?

          - [ ] Next target customer: Does this nich is a door to an other one?



*** Positioning

    <<8163>> Positioning :=

          - [ ] Pick a location in the [[file:img/competitive-positioning-compass.jpg][competitive positioning compass]].

          - [ ] <<2026>> Use the [[49cc][market alternative]] and the [[45d6][product alternative]]
            so that the market can locate your company's unique value: a [[3fd3][claim]],
            an [[2d40][evidence]], a communication (how to transmit [[3fd3][claim]], and [[2d40][evidence]]),
            feedback and adjustments (because competitors will launch
            counter-measures).

              - [ ] <<49cc>> market alternative := company that the target
                consumer has been buying for years.  The problem they address is
                the one we address.  The budget they represent is the money we
                are going to represent.

              - [ ] <<45d6>> product alternative := competitor challenging the
                [[49cc][market alternative]].

              - [ ] <<3fd3>> claim := someone has to understand the claim in a
                few sentences: the elevator pitch. For /beachhead target
                customer segment/, who are dissatisfied with /the current [[49cc][market
                alternative]]/ our product is a /new product category/ that
                provides /key problem-solving capability/ unlike /product
                alternative/ we have assembled /key whole profuct features for
                your specific application/

              - [ ] <<2d40>> evidence := [[file:img/positioning-evidence.jpg][positioning evidence]]

          - [[8163][Positioning]] is the single largest influence on the buying decision,
            it exists in people's heads already not in your words and doesn't
            like stuff to change.  It's goal is to make a product easier to
            buy. It follows a couple of rules:

              - [ ] Name it and frame it. Minimum for tech enthousiasts ex:
                "middleware" (just a name) renamed to "enterprise application
                integration" (name + frame).

              - [ ] Who for and what for. Minimum for visionnaries.

              - [ ] Competition and differentiation.  Setup the context so that
                pragmatist can evaluate how much to pay for what.

              - [ ] Financials and futures. Makes sure that the entity behind
                the product is here to stay. Minimum for conservative.
