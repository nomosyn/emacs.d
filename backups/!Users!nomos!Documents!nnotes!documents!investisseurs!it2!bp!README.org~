* Problem: how to share and improve nnotes bp ?

  - Conditions:
      - We are 4 to work on it

      - It's a static document

      - It's going to be on the web like http://www.spotifyartists.com/spotify-explained/



* Solution

  - What?
      - Shared over the web, Simple, protected, improvable static document =>
        jekyll website deployed with heroku

  - How?
      - Static simple web document: jekyll website
          - Content is here: code/_includes/nnotes-bp.html

      - Improvable: [[http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22][C4.1]] workflow over the ./code/ folder

      - Protected: login/pwd are in the config.ru file.

      - Shared: just share the address (nnotes-bp.herokuapp.com) and login/pwd (nnotes-bp-1234/nnotes-bp-1234)

      - Localhost deploy:
          - intall gem somehow

          - $ gem install jekyll

          - $ cd ./code/

          - $ jekyll serve

          - http://localhost:4000/

      - (PH) Deploy on the web: `$ ./deploy.sh`
          - https://toolbelt.heroku.com/ should be installed
