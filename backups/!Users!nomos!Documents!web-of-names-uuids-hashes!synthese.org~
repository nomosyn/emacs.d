* The web of names, hashes and UUIDs

  - To track a document that changes between untrested peers it's needed to
    define a header to the file that contains:

      - Its name because convenient and easy to use

      - Its uuid because allows to track content that changes with time

      - Its hash (SHA<version>) because allows total precision in managing content.
